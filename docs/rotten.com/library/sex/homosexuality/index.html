<h1>Homosexuality</h1>
Don't forget the self-loathing homos of the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/history/nazi/gay/index.html">Gay Third Reich</a>, or the homophobic teachings of <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/bio/religion/fred-phelps/index.html">Fred Phelps</a>.

You know what happened to the Greeks. Homosexuality destroyed them. Sure, Aristotle was a homo, we all know that, so was Socrates. [...] Do you know what happened to the Romans? The last six <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/bio/royalty/romans/index.html">Roman emperors</a> were fags. [...] You know what happened to the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/bio/religion/popes/index.html">popes</a>? It's all right that popes were laying the nuns. That's been going on for years—centuries. But when the popes, when the Catholic Church went to hell in—I don't know, three or four centuries ago—it was homosexual, and it had to be cleaned out. Now, that's what happened to Britain; it happened earlier to France."</font></td>

It's no different. It is the same thing. It is happening all over again. It is the Democratic Congress, the liberal-based media and the homosexuals who want to destroy the Christians. Wholesale abuse and discrimination and the worst bigotry directed toward any group in America today. More terrible than anything suffered by any minority in history."</font></td>

not improper in itself. What is improper is the use of organs [such as] the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/sex/oral-sex/index.html">mouth</a> or the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/sex/anal-sex/index.html">anus</a>... already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact."</font></td>

You tolerate everything. Homosexuals are riding high in the media. For example, in the Cayman Islands, which is a British colony or whatever they call it now—it's an independent thing—in order to establish full relationships with England, England is insisting that they recognize homosexuals and the Cayman Islands are saying: 'We're Christians and we'd rather not do it.' And in Scotland you can't believe how strong the homosexuals are. It's just simply unbelievable. And so as far as the vestiges of John Knox and some of these heroes, I don't think it exists any more. And what could happen? It could go right back to the darkness very easily."</font></td>

And if we want to destroy the United States of America, take it down, this is the best way to do it. So the homosexuals will have managed to win what's known as a pyrrhic victory—they may win their temporary battle, but they'll lose the war 'cause they will destroy the society, and that's happening."</font></td>
