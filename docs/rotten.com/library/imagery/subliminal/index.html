<h1>Subliminals</h1>
There's nothing to <i>foodhungrysexbuy</i> see here.
<p>
The concept behind the subliminal is pretty amazing, assuming you buy into it. And make no mistake, there's a lot to buy into.
<p>
First of all, you have to buy into the idea that your brain is so amazing, so incredible, that it has this ability to pick up subtle clues, concepts and ideas from microscopic flashes or many-levels-buried audio/visual experience. The brain is certainly a mind-blowing concept (in fact, if you think about it, that's a <i>brain</i> blowing </i>itself</i> with <i>concepts</i> it's <i>thinking of</i>, which is in itself a mind-blowing concept), but this is a level above that. Not only is it regulating breathing and crapping and making sure you know which bottle is beer and which is shoe polish, but it's also studying <i>every frame of film</i> for intense images which it will then file somewhere in the back, near the Repressed Molestation Memory Locker. It's listening to <i>every piece of music backwards</i> as well as forward, looking some great ideas of what to do this evening. And everywhere, in cubes of ice or blades of grass or in wood grain, it's trying to find the word SEX so that it can, in an <i>amazing change of priorities</i>, consider fucking something.
<p>
Or, to quote the comedian Emo Phillips, "I used to think the brain was the most fascinating part of the body. Then I thought, "Look what's telling me that."
<p>
But assuming you do buy into this concept, then you're going to find amazing stuff hidden <i>everywhere</i>; in advertisements, in your records, on television and movies... all trying to scare you into submission, and directing you, you lame zombie, towards the next mindless purchase.
