President <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/index.html">George W Bush</a> had a serious problem. In 2002, he was trying to sell the American people a war against Iraqi despot <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/index.html">Saddam Hussein</a>. But despite a wide selection of rationales offered to justify the thing, very few people were buying. When none of his advertising slogans seemed to be working, Bush had no choice but to employ a little old-fashioned puffery.
<p>
So the President and his lackeys tweaked the message. They started promoting the idea that Saddam currently possessed significant <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/history/war/wmd/index.html">weapons of mass destruction</a>, poised to strike the United States and Britain. <i>That</i> certainly got people's attention. In fact, it scared the shit out of them. Public opinion quickly swayed in favor of military intervention, and the rest is history.
<p>
Since the war, however, millions of Americans have concluded that they are victims of false advertising. None of the fabled WMDs has actually shown up, despite months of intensive searching. Understandably, people feel they were lied to.
<p>
But let's start at the beginning. Prior to the 2001 <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/index.html">al Qaeda</a> attacks against the Pentagon and the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/history/wtc/index.html">World Trade Center</a>, Bush and his administration were openly uncommitted as to whether there were any extant WMDs in Iraq:

Then Secretary of State Colin Powell went to the United Nations for a Show 'N Tell presentation. He passed around recent surveillance photos taken of Iraqi WMD sites. According to Powell, the black-and-white pictures depicted a chemical weapons complex in Al-Musayyib, as well as 15 chemical weapons bunkers in Taji.

Although the briefing was vague on many details, Powell's exhibits were too specific and numerous to be ignored. Taken in total, they seemed to portray an ongoing biological and chemical weapons production effort under way in Iraq.
