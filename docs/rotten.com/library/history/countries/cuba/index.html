<h2>Embargo</h2>
Under American embargo since 1960 because Cuba is a puppet state of the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/history/countries/soviet-union/index.html">Soviet Union</a>. Oh wait, that's over now. Under embargo since 1989 because, umm, uhh, I forget. We want to support Democracy or something. After all, we have a long history of supporting Democracy, such as in Chile (architecting the overthrow by <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/agosto-pinochet/index.html">Augusto Pinochet</a> of the democratically elected but mildly socialist government of Salvador Allende); in Colombia (American support of death squads who killed over three thousand); in El Salvador (American support of death squads who killed many thousands), in <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/history/countries/iraq/index.html">Iraq</a> (American support of the regime of democrat <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/index.html">Saddam Hussein</a>, including providing him with biological weapons.)
<p>
By all means, this embargo must continue. It's important!
