John Wayne Gacy was a pillar of his community. He would dress up as Pogo the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/sideshow/clowns/index.html">Clown</a> to entertain children and owned his own local business. He also liked to strangle young men and store bodies under his house. Recently, he's gotten a second career as a artist, making paintings in his jail cell. Adapt or die!
<p>
When police officers asked Gacy about a two-by-four affixed with handcuffs they found in his home, he replied that he got the idea from <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/bio/crime/serial-killers/elmer-wayne-henley/index.html">Elmer Wayne Henley</a>.
