Lunatic who claims that the world is run by the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/conspiracy/illuminati/index.html" />Illuminati</a>—composed of fourth-dimensional reptilian humanoid extraterrestrials—through the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/conspiracy/freemasonry/index.html" />Masons</a>, the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/conspiracy/trilateral-commission/index.html">Trilateral Commission</a>, the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/conspiracy/bilderberg-group/index.html">Bilderberg Group</a>, and the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/conspiracy/cfr/index.html">Council on Foreign Relations</a>. The reptiles are child-sacrificing, blood-drinking <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/religion/satanism/index.html">Satanists</a>. Their membership includes:
<p>
<blockquote>
<a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-hw-bush/index.html">George HW Bush</a>, <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/bill-clinton/index.html">Bill Clinton</a>, <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/bio/usa/hillary-clinton/index.html">Hillary Clinton</a>, <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/bio/usa/henry-kissinger/index.html">Henry Kissinger</a>, Bob Hope, Kris Kristofferson, Queen Elizabeth, and the Queen Mother.

Before he became a world-class nutball, Icke was a professional soccer goalie and later a BBC television sportscaster. Then he went nuts and publicly proclaimed himself the Son of God.

Endorsed the authenticity of the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/hoaxes/zion-protocols/index.html">Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</a>.

I strongly believe that a small Jewish clique which has contempt for the mass of Jewish people worked with non-Jews to create the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/history/war/wwi/index.html">First World War</a>, the Russian Revolution, and the <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/history/war/wwii/index.html">Second World War</a>. ... They then dominated the Versailles Peace Conference and created the circumstances which made the Second World War inevitable. They financed <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/bio/nazi/adolf-hitler/index.html">Hitler</a> to power in 1933 and made the funds available for his rearmament.

For a decade Icke has exhibited signs of serious mental instability. In his web site autobiography he reveals that as early as 1990 he became aware of "a presence around me, like there was always someone in the room when there was not. It got to the point where I sat on the side of the bed in a hotel room in London in early 1990 and said to whoever or whatever: "If you are there will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall." A year later, on holiday in Peru, Icke describes hearing voices: "as I looked at the mound, a voice in my head began to say: "Come to me, come to me, come to me.... Suddenly I felt my feet pulled to the ground again like a magnet, the same as in the newspaper shop, but this time far more powerful. My arms then shot above my head, with no decision by me for them to do so.... A flow of powerful energy began to go into the top of my head like a drill, and I could feel the flow going the other way up from the ground through my feet. It was then I heard the third voice in my head, something that has never happened since. It said very clearly: "It will be over when you feel the rain"."
