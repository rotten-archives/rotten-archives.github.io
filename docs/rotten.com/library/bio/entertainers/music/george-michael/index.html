<td valign=top><font size=-1>In Britain, pop singer George Michael complains to ITV1's <i>Tonight With Trevor McDonald</i> that he cannot safely return to the United States after a critical story in the <i>New York Post</i>: "It's been very heavily inferred that I was actually an <a href="/docs/rotten.com/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/index.html">al Qaeda</a> sympathiser, that somehow I thought that there was something not horrific and shocking about the attacks on September 11. I was trying to do some damage control because my life was in danger. Americans are very reactionary right now and I—because of that article—cannot return to America, even though my partner lives there."</font></td>
